# landauDeGUI

This repository contains code that (a) calculates liquid crystal stuff (in a phenomenological,
landau deGennes Q-tensor framework), and also (b) provides an (optional, but on by default)
graphical user interface for running and setting up the simulations. It is a GPU-accelerated
package, although in can also be run in CPU-only mode (indeed, one does not even need a GPU
on the machine running it, although CUDA is still required for compilation).

Some doxygen documentation has been written, but lots of stuff is still to be written. In any
event, executing the command
"doxygen doc/landauDeGUI_documentation"
from the root directory will produce a set of html documentation files that may (or may not!)
be helpful.

# Basic compilation

see "INSTALLATION.md" for a few more details.
