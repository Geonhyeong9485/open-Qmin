# open Qmin

This repository contains code for performing lattice-discretized Landau deGennes liquid crystal modeling, using single or multiple CPU or GPU resources for efficient, large-scale simulations.
Included is an optional
graphical user interface for running and setting up the simulations.

Some doxygen documentation has been written, but lots of stuff is still to be written. In any
event, executing the command
"doxygen doc/openQmin_documentation"
from the root directory will produce a set of html documentation files.

# Basic compilation

see "INSTALLATION.md" for a few more details. Note that the "noQT" branch has stripped away all code related to the GUI for easy installation in environments without QT installed or where it is not necessary (e.g., on clusters)

## Project information
Here are some convenient links to a variety of general information about the landau deGUI project; all
of the below can also be accessed from the @ref projectInfo tab (links work on the gitlab.io
documenation website). Alternately, you can look at the markdown (.md) files in the base directory and the doc/markdown/
directories
